To "install" / get the contents of this repo (we call it git pull):
1. Have a GitHub account and download git.
2. Navigate to the directory on the command line that you want to put the DSA3101 materials in.
   - The command line can be accessed via searching for the "command prompt", but I personally use a terminal on the Windows Store
   - Following instructions should be the same for both Windows and Mac
   - To go to a directory, you can use cd
   - To create a directory, you can use mkdir <filename>.
4. Type git init to initialise a repository
5. git checkout -b <branch_name> to change to a different branch. Name the branch whatever you like
